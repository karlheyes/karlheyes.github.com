    <p>This is the current set of branches of ices2 and icecast2. They are based on the Xiph offical
    release with features based on feedback from people. Some of these features are not suitable for
    distribution from Xiph, like the FLV wrapping/mpeg parsing, others are more suited for large scale
    installations.  You can contact me karl &lt;at&gt; kheyes.plus.com</p>

    <br/>

    <p>Main releases</p>
    ices0 patch for avoiding cue file and zombie process creation, often seen on centovacast setups <a href="ices.zombie.diff">Here</a><br />
    Latest KH development work is now up on github <a href="https://github.com/karlheyes/icecast-kh">Here</a>
    <br/><br/>

    <a href="https://github.com/karlheyes/icecast-kh/archive/refs/tags/icecast-2.4.0-kh20.tar.gz">2.4.0-kh20</a> <br/>
    <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/icecastkh/files/icecast-2.4.0-kh20_win32_setup.exe/download">2.4.0-kh20 (win32) </a> <br/>
    <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/icecastkh/files/icecast-2.4.0-kh20_win64_setup.exe/download">2.4.0-kh20 (win64) </a> <br/>
    <p>7/3/2023</p>
    This is a small but important fix release, not much changed.
    <ul>
    <li>config lock imbalance fix. Shows as a lockup on reload or exit.
    <li>request HTTP 1.0 on relay requests, some send chunked responses which make a mess of ICY metadata.
    <li>other minor code changes that do not have a functional effect.
    </ul>

    <a href="https://github.com/karlheyes/icecast-kh/archive/refs/tags/icecast-2.4.0-kh19.tar.gz">2.4.0-kh19</a> <br/>
    <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/icecastkh/files/icecast-2.4.0-kh19_win32_setup.exe/download">2.4.0-kh19 (win32) </a> <br/>

    <p>5/3/2023</p>
    <ul>
    <li>Another update to xml parsing. Allows for cleaner and more flexible handling of
    parameters and tags.
    Added fallback to mirror fallback-mount, so that it reads better in certain cases
    eg &lt;fallback mount="/backup" rate="128k"/&gt;. The other layouts are also handled.
    Empty tags are now ignored, seen with some with intro tags
    original shoutcast port compatability settings handled better.
    <li>Optional feature, set hijack to true on mount to allow a source to kick off the
    existing stream without touching listeners. This is primarily for replacing a
    relay stream as a replacment for fallback handling as it keeps listeners on the
    same mountpoint. While the feature will stay, the exact methos to enable is still
    subject for change but setting this on the mount block is reasonable.
    <li>fix relay intialization failure case.
    <li>relay internal state fix on reload. restart on certain changes.
    <li>range header case fixed. playback issue in browsers
    <li>various code cleanups, possible lockup issues resolved, crash cases, work done at shutdown etc.
    <li>reduce some excessive logging in certain cases.
    </ul>

    <a href="https://github.com/karlheyes/icecast-kh/archive/refs/tags/icecast-2.4.0-kh18.tar.gz">2.4.0-kh18</a> <br/>
    <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/icecastkh/files/icecast-2.4.0-kh18_win32_setup.exe/download">2.4.0-kh18 (win32) </a> <br/>
    <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/icecastkh/files/icecast-2.4.0-kh18_win64_setup.exe/download">2.4.0-kh18 (win64) </a> <br/>
    <p>2/2/2023</p>
    <ul>
    <li>Extend http headers work from previous release.
    Can now be used to create POST data. This improves code readability and also allows for more flexability.
    Make global http headers work as expected.
    <li>Switchover updates.
    Cleaner handling when switching over the client for a relay or source.
    Interacts with inactive on-demand relays.
    <li>Introduce the linger-on mount setting. On stream exit, the stream goes into a
    state where it stays around running but no feed comes in. This allows for a
    delayed termination if you have relays or sources that drop but reconnect
    but you do not want to keep dropping to fallbacks. During this state, you can
    connect another source so can be used as a switch over between sources.
    <li>Various libcurl interaction updates. tigher control on callback handling
    Handle server shutdown interrupting libcurl requests quicker.
    <li>Trap for HTTP request on shoutcast port and treat it as such.
    <li>Various code cleanups that have been reported.
    </ul>

    <a href="https://github.com/karlheyes/icecast-kh/archive/refs/tags/icecast-2.4.0-kh17.tar.gz">2.4.0-kh17</a> <br/>
    <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/icecastkh/files/icecast-2.4.0-kh17_win32_setup.exe/download">2.4.0-kh17 (win32) </a> <br/>
    <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/icecastkh/files/icecast-2.4.0-kh17_win64_setup.exe/download">2.4.0-kh17 (win64) </a> <br/>
    <p>18/1/2023</p>
    <p>Report on the global http-headers causing a crash, now fixed in master, will update these build soon but you can
    use these if you do not intend to use global http-headers.</p>
    <ul>
    <li>HTTP handling update. A lot of this is internal but the mechanism allows for
    updating http headers from the XML using the http-headers block at the global
    level or per mount point.  The same sort of block can be used within the relay
    for specifying any headers to a relay.
    <li> XML parsing updates. This allows for simple tags to be embedded into the parent
    tag.  examples include<br/>
<pre>
    &lt;listen-socket port="8000" /&gt;
    &lt;mount mount-name="/stream"&gt;
    ...
    &lt;/mount&gt;
    &lt;relay local-mount="/stream" on-demand="true"&gt;
      &lt;host server="master1" port="8000" mount="/feed-1" /&gt;
      &lt;host server="master2" port="9000" mount="/feed-2" /&gt;
    &lt;/relay&gt;
    </pre>
    <li>Relay hijack capability. Two possible use cases
    <ul>
    <li>In the multiple host relay situation, every relay-delay seconds, the previously
    failed but higher priority hosts are re-tried and if one works then switches in
    to provide the feed for the stream. listeners are not moved.

    <li>A source client can override a relay on the same mount point without moving
    listeners.  This effectively shuts down the pulling part of the relay but stays
    around until the source client exits, at which point the relay restarts.  This can
    be seen as another type of fallback, one without the issue of shared fallback mounts
    causing listeners to end up on unexpected mount points. As the listeners stay in one
    place then things like stats are more consistent.
    </ul><br />
    <li>SSL can be used on relay feed. Use boolean tag ssl or tls on the above host. The
    relay can redirect to https to achieve the same thing.

    <li>priority tag on relay to allow for order host startup different to the order in
    the XML. 1 is highest order, unspecified implies ordered per XML.

    <li>add ignore case for user agent matching.

    <li>priority tag on mount to allow for search order when you can match multiple mount
    blocks (due to wildcard).

    <li>Small update to CORS handling, interaction with http work.
    <li>fnmatch (wildcard handling was broken in windows now fixed) and can use extended
    settings like @ etc
    <li>Minor web page update
    <li>Document updates.
    </ul>

    <a href="https://github.com/karlheyes/icecast-kh/archive/refs/tags/icecast-2.4.0-kh16.tar.gz">2.4.0-kh16</a> <br/>
    <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/icecastkh/files/icecast-2.4.0-kh16_win32_setup.exe/download">2.4.0-kh16 (win32) </a> <br/>

    <p>7/12/2022</p>
    <ul>
    <li>Locking updates. Mostly for the config, mount lookup and client processing.
    <li>Add redirect_limit to auth URL options, default 1 but 0-10 allowed.
    <li>If URL Post is too large then avoid the backend request.
    <li>Fix up the slow SSL response on web requests.
    <li>The id flag on killclient command did not handle very large numbers
    <li>Drop the source limit check on relay startup. Did not make much sense.
    <li>Fix some keepalive client issues.
    <li>log reopening fix
    <li>Ogg FLaC header fix
    <li>Various internal code changes.
    <li>update auto* build setup
    </ul>

    <a href="https://github.com/karlheyes/icecast-kh/archive/icecast-2.4.0-kh15.tar.gz">2.4.0-kh15</a> <br/>

    <p>1/7/2020</p>
    <ul>
    <li>Locking updates. For most, it will be no different but some platforms can be affected
    <li>Keep consistency on the global listener count. Could of shown as very large number.
    <li>Fix issue with fallback override of listeners. listeners being dropped
    <li>Fix broken parameter to on-[dis]connect script on previous release.
    <li>Small update for CORS handling.
    <li>Fix YP updating.  Long standing error flagged up on directory changes.
    <li>Update for listeners moving between workers for load balancing.
    <li>Small update for the FLV-aac wrapping in previous release.
    <li>Fix up range request bug.
    <li>Fix various log related issues.
    <li>Some internal code cleanup
    </ul>

    <a href="https://github.com/karlheyes/icecast-kh/archive/icecast-2.4.0-kh14.tar.gz">2.4.0-kh14</a> <br/>

    <p>26/4/2020</p>
    <ul>
    <li>Allow for using secs (eg 5s) in queue/min-queue/burst measures.
    <li>Allow multiple icy sources on same port. Just embed in password a mountpoint:pass. The
    shoutcast-mount tag still creates the +1 port and sets a default mountpoint but source
    can override this.
    <li>Fix log issue which could cause a deadlock if on-[dis]connect or auth cmd are used.
    <li>Allow configure to accept ICY_CHARSET to set alternate in build.  The default ICY
    metadata is assumed to be UTF8, but some sites still have issues with setting tags or
    parameters, so allow a different default if they need it.
    <li>Regression on FLV wrapped aac metadata fixed.
    <li>Crash/corruption fix if using stream auth and metadata updates via admin.
    <li>Fix for glibc rwlock priority
    <li>Added the icy-metadata in headers allowed with CORS
    <li>Rework XFF to be earlier, useful in cases where banned IPs apply.
    <li>Allow wildcards in XFF
    <li>Drop the BSD NOPUSH setting for now. Have seen poor performance because of it in
    certain cases
    <li>Openssl API cleanups. eg API differences between versions.
    <li>various small fixes, build and operational.
    </ul>

    <p>28/1/2020</p>
    <ul>
    <li>Fix an annoying race case. memory corruption in certain cases that are hard to trigger normally but typically involes a listener disconnecting in certain conditions.
    <li>Tightened up use-after-free cases with regard to the queue pruning.
    <li>leak fixes with intro via auth.
    <li>Allow seconds to be specified in burst and queue size fields. Just specify the number followed by s eg 30s  or 5s. Eventually we could make this the default so that is can apply to various bitrates.
    <li>small minor cleanups across the board.
    </ul>

    <p>26/3/2019</p>
    <ul>
    <li>fix up some incorrect or stale block cases from previous release for non-ogg streams. Usually cause by short write triggers or queue jumps.
    <li>change default charset for non-ogg streams to utf8 instead of latin1, you ca still use latin1 either with &lt;charset&gt; mount setting or charset= query param to metadata
    <li>global listeners count could get messed up with fallback to files, also make it a regular update stat in-line with other global stats.
    <li>avoid possible crash case on log re-opening, not so common.

    <p>4/2/2019</p>
    <ul>
    <li>fix issue with timelimited listeners and html5 players with range requests
    <li>security fix for auth url when allowing certain headers to be passed.
    <li>fix for mpeg block expansion handling, led to cases of parsing failures
    <li>block scaling changes for mpeg based streams.
    <li>internal restructure for metadata on non-ogg streams. For code maintainability.
    <li>bounce admin mount request clients to worker with the source, reduces lock contention with lots of sources

    <p>27/5/2018</p>
    <ul>
    <li>stop ID3 in streams for now, some browsers can have playback problems.
    <li>fix memory leak case in the queue from previous release.
    <li>fix crash bug on source timeout
    <li>various internal changes for building, rate calculations

    <p>18/3/2018</p>
    <ul>
    <li>pre-roll logging options. like access log but report client details of intros played. Can be
    per-mount or global. Also allow for IP recording to prevent intro play if reconnected within
    N seconds.
    <li>add tag ssl-cafile to refer to a CA bundle other than the default. This way the cert is not
    required to include it.
    <li>allow /admin/metadata to accept param intro or preroll to change the intro file used on a source.
    <li>split explicit mounts from list into a tree for quick lookup. speeds up updating with many mount
    definitions.
    <li>max-listeners setting in limits for server wide limitations.
    <li>worker balancing updates. avoid a lot of bouncing between workers for sources and allow more
    listeners to be attracted to their source worker.
    <li>clean up shutdown procedure for race handling.
    <li>smaller SSL handling cleanup.
    <li>log messaging update.
    <li>mpeg parsing updates. Allows for better detection and reporting, identifies mismatches better,
    and detects a few more frame types. The sync structure is also reduced so should help in caching.
    <li>rate averaging update.
    <li>minor tuning for intro drops, fix for 0- range requests and intros.

    <ul>
    <li>Logging. An issue was reported on log cycling triggers, should be the last now. This time it
    seems to stem from a cycle triggered externally where a new log is created for appending before
    doing the reopen.  This is now fixed.

    <li>Expand the worker limiter when processing lots of clients in one pass. This was leading to
    some seeing sources not getting cleaned up as the listeners were not getting serviced.  There
    is still a cap but is extermely large and can be bypassed on cleanup cases.

    <li>Incoming worker thread added. Normally incoming clients, after passing the initial IP checks
    get passed on to worker threads for subsequent pocessing.   This can lead to a lot of wakeups
    for the usual worker threads to process these especially if they are short (eg playlist) or
    involve filtering or kicking off auth. The extreme case being a DoS type of thing, where the
    wakeup often causes the worker to do a big list traversal slowing things down as it gets busy.
    This new worker thread deals with the initial aspects, http parsing, initial request handling
    and is only moved to the normal workers for sources, listeners and some static content.

    <li>Add "headers" and "header_prefix" options onto auth url. To bring into line with the Xiph
    build.  It is possible that some sites would want to inspect certain headers passed by
    clients to authenticate. We do not want to pass all of them as that can be large and for such
    situations, particular headers are limited, the prime example of these is cookies.  To avoid
    POST tag name clashes with existing established tags passed in aurl auth, these headers are
    supplied with a prefix, defaulting to "ClientHeader-"

    <li>Stats. A number of global stats are now reported every 10 seconds or the next second if
    they have changed.  This reduces load on a stats link and can save on logging if you have
    that level enabled.

    <li>A small set of code cleanups

        <li>sent value passed to listener_remove in kh1 could be wrong on 32bit setups</li>
        <li>avoid clearing queue on relay restart, it exposed a crash case with lock changes</li>
        <li>make TCP sockets not pass to on-[dis]connect scripts. useless work avoided</li>
        <li>hijack source fix required with lock changes, to avoid mis-calculated lags drops</li>
        <li>refcount bug missed for sending to master relays. possible memory corruption</li>
        <li>more worker balancing changes, to spread loading more evenly.</li>
        <li>missing delay for blocking file client, has an effect of higher cpu usage</li>
        <li>rare override failure case handled better.</li>
        <li>various minor fixes, including log format, memory leak and stats.</li>

    <ul>
    <li>Big change with rwlocks replacing mutexes. It's internal but can have a big effect
    on load pattern usage. In cases with many listeners on a single mount we can now
    spread clients across all workers. A number of balancing changes were done to
    assist in localising related clients but may need more tweaking.  A side effect
    of these changes is that queues are only shrunk when there are no listeners, so
    queues can take up more memory than usual but that could of happened before.</li>
    <li>fix bad reference for file-based content like intro/fallback with FLV</li>
    <li>make the minimum duration of an on-demand relay last until it would be classed as
    working, any less then it could be skipped or disabled for a short time.</li>
    <li>skip entity decoding if none required.  For cases where metadata has &amp; causing
    the libxml2 to spit out warnings like "no name".</li>
    <li>If no sockets are opened at the start then exit.</li>
    <li>Win32. standardize on format for date, back to proper timezone numbers</li>
    <li>Log AAC samplerate change in stream.</li>
    <li>Add &lt;inactivity-timeout&gt; in &lt;limits&gt; to stop icecast when there are no sources</li>
    <li>Add &lt;x-forwarded-for&gt; into &lt;paths&gt; for IP substitution from load balancers</li>
    <li>Added referer= to listener_add POST.</li>
    <li>Added sent= to listener_remove POST (bytes)</li>
    <li>sync ebml/webm format parser with 2.3.3, not tried it myself.</li>
    <li>minor tweaks for rescheduling on high bitrate streams, terminating sources, URL
    auth handling if disabled and busy relay restarting.</li>

    <ul>
    <li>Expand file open limit to match &lt;clients&gt; if possible, warn if less.
    <li>Fix possible client leak. legacy code removal.
    <li>updated mpeg parser to be more specific on bits to match for. It should increase
    the tolerance for changes in the stream format (CRC, samplerate etc).
    <li>reload forces an update of active streams, was missing from a previous update.
    <li>Realplayer based apps fix for aac+. Assumes certain response header.
    <li>drop requirement for matching each / in mount-name.
    <li>content type needed truncating in rare cases before format could be set up
    <li>prevent too much being read in one go when reading ogg data.
    <li>internal change to swapping of hijacked clients, possible crash fix.
    <li>fallback over multiple mounts works again 
    <li>Add timeout for sync mode handling. Should never trigger really.
    <li>a few small log reporting changes.

    <ul>
    <li>Reduce memory copies with large stream lists from master
    <li>internal FLV buffer management cleaned up, possible crash case avoided.
    <li>return 501 instead of 400 for HEAD requests, helps some players.
    <li>stats updating reduced now that relays always have clients, also reduce locking.
    <li>missing user/pass setting for metadata update from shoutcast style source and url auth
    <li>Experimental. send variable block framing if requested by listener
    <li>Experimental. allow &lt;include&gt;/dir/*.xml&lt;/include&gt; in &lt;icecast&gt; for
    breaking xml up
    <li>Experimental. webm work by David Richards
    <li>Experimental.  source client hijacking. replace existing source with another. has to
    to allowed via auth url currently to prevent bouncing of clients with auto-reconnect.
    <li>Add duration to all access, error and playlist logs, allows re-opening them after a
    number of seconds elapsed, 0 by default. set size trigger to 50Meg default.
    <li>possible busy loop in kh31 in cases where fallback is defined
    <li>fix for win32 error reporting and missing uninstall link in programs list
    <li>added "timeout" (default 5) and "on_error_wait" (default 60) to auth url options.
    <li>sync up headers handled by auth cmd with auth url.
    <li>Added missing stream format checks for certain error cases.
    <li>speedup for icy metadata and avoid length bug on inline urls.
    <li>A number of possible lock fixes and checks are now added for odd cases.
